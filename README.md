# UFOs

## Challenge
The purpose of the project was to create a website that would filter data on UFO sightings. The data had information on the date, city, state, country, shape, and duration, as well as a few comments on the sighting. The programs used in in the website are a JavaScript application as well as a CSS file to style the website. To further enhance the site, I would suggest a dropdown menu for the filters, so that the user knows exactly what is available to search. It would also be useful if the filter search did not need to be exact and would return data that closely resemble what the user inputs.
